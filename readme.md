# Kirby custom country field

Custom country form field for kirby. [Countries used](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search) (select ‘Country codes’).

## Installation

Place the `country` folder in `/site/fields`.

### Todo

I’ll probabaly convert this into a field with a `datalist` as soon as [Safari has support](http://caniuse.com/#search=datalist) for it.
